/*Coding Challenge #1
 Mark and Sant are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
 calculated using the formula:
 BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
 and height in meter).
 Your tasks:
 1. Store Sant's and Jay's mass and height in variables
 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
 versions)
 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
 whether Sant has a higher BMI than Jay.
 Test data:
 Â§ Data 1: Sants weights 69 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
 m tall.
 Â§ Data 2: Jays weights 85 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
 m tall.
 GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€*/

// const massSant = 69;
// const hightSant = 1.69;
// const massJay = 85;
// const hightJay = 1.88;

// const BMISant = massSant / hightSant ** 2;
// const BMIJay = massJay / hightJay ** 2;
// const JayhigherBMI = BMISant <   BMIJay;

// console.log(BMISant, BMIJay, JayhigherBMI);
